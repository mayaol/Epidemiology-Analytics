# Hello!
Welcome to my portfolio. My topics of interest are epidemiology, health metrics, infectious disease and health economics. I have a background in public health and healthcare, and I am working to grow my skills in data analytics as well. I believe utilizing data management and visualization are key aspects of disseminating public health research and results. It is vital to master these skills in order to provide better insights for stakeholders and the general public, and therefore support a healthier future. I hope to harness my data skills in tandem with public health knowledge to support the various organizations working to improve the health of populations across the world.

### Analyses
**professional_dev/portfolio/analytics** - This is my first introductory analysis, using basic functions in R with the dplyr and ggplot2 packages. Here, I utilized **United Nations population estimates** to perform some data management tasks and create several visualizations using the data. My main goal with this analysis was to explore the UN dataset and practice some simple R functions.
 - 1.1 Find out which countries had/will have the highest population in each given year: 1950, 1975, 2000, 2025, and 2050
 - 1.2 Find out which country had the greatest change in population from 1950 to 2000
 - 1.3 Calculate each country's Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and check that it matches what is reported
 - 2.0 World map of population density by country for the year 2015
